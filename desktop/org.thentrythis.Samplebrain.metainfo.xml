    <p>
      Samplebrain chops samples up into a &apos;brain&apos; of interconnected small sections called blocks which are connected into a network by similarity. It processes a target sample, chopping it up into blocks in the same way, and tries to match each block with one in it&apos;s brain to play in realtime.

    <p>
      This allows you to interpret a sound with a different one. As we worked on it (during 2015 and 2016) we gradually added more and more tweakable parameters until it became slightly out of control.
